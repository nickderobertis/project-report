## Overview

This repo is a template to use for starting a new Python package
which is hosted on PyPi and uses Sphinx for documentation
hosted on Github pages. It has a built-in CI/CD system using Github Actions. See 
[the example generated repo](https://github.com/whoopnip/pypi-sphinx-quickstart)
for features and setup. This README is kept minimal as you will be replacing
its content after using `cookiecutter`.

## Getting Started

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet:

    pip install -U cookiecutter

Generate a Python package project:

    cookiecutter https://github.com/whoopnip/cookiecutter-pypi-sphinx.git
    
Follow the instructions on 
[the example generated repo](https://github.com/whoopnip/pypi-sphinx-quickstart)
for the remaining setup.
